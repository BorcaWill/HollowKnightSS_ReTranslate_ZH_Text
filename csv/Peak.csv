MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_TALK_04,"&lt;hpage&gt;The bugs of your land, I have watched them, climbing towards their absolution without the flicker of a thought to what it means.&lt;page&gt;Aye. But isn&#8217;t it always such for those snared to serve your higher caste?&lt;page&gt;Our mortal mob did once act some defiance, unawares maybe, but successful in part, goaded towards it by Weavers&#8217; will&#8217;n all.&lt;hpage&gt;You speak of the Citadel? Its former function has failed, but I can still sense its purpose, some. It is church and cage both.&lt;page&gt;Aye. Devised by your ancestors that monstrosity, and their wicked, clever minds. A system, or a web they&#8217;d likely call it, a way to keep their mother sealed in slumber, and themselves free to lavish in their false rule.",＆lt; hpage＆gt;您土地的虫子，我看着它们，朝着它们的赦免爬上，而没有思考的意思。但是，对于那些诱惑的人来说，我们的凡人曾经曾经做过一些蔑视，也许没有意识到，但在某种程度上取得了成功，这总是这样的人，但在某种程度上是成功的，这是weavers＆＃8217;您会说城堡吗？它以前的功能失败了，但我仍然可以感觉到它的目的，有些。它是教堂和笼子。由您的祖先设计的，这些怪兽和他们邪恶，聪明的头脑。他们可能会称呼它的系统或网络，是一种使母亲封锁沉睡的方式，并自由地在虚假的规则中奢侈。
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_DELIVERY,"&lt;hpage&gt;Maker, I bring a delivery from Bellhart below, lacquer for your long work.&lt;page&gt;Ahh. Know you distort the order of things, Old One. It is a rare want of your caste to serve us mortal bugs.&lt;hpage&gt;I am not my kin, Maker. I have seen enough pain born of their dominion. As much as I may, I choose to stand apart.&lt;page&gt;If your blood allows it so... And my thanks still for the lacquer. Pharloom&#8217;s fresh faces will welcome its sheen.",＆lt; hpage＆gt; Maker，我从下面的贝哈特（Bellhart）带来了一份漆，漆了您的长期工作。知道您会扭曲事物的顺序，旧的。为我们提供凡人虫子，这是您种姓的难得。我已经看到了他们的统治人数足够多的痛苦。尽我所能，我选择分开。伪造的新面孔将欢迎其光泽。

Unmasked, the task becomes heavy. &lt;hpage&gt;I had the desire to hear you lucid, Maker, though you may protest.&lt;page&gt;Aye. Well its no great shock to have you visit. I&#8217;ve felt the stirrings of our monarch, even all the way out here, the tremors of her kin brought close.&lt;page&gt;You&#8217;re planning a confrontation with her then? The one atop? Our great, frayed god?&lt;hpage&gt;Our meeting seems inevitable, though first I seek the strength to ensure a favourable outcome.&lt;page&gt;Ha! As I&#8217;d have guessed! Your ancient kind aren&#8217;t told to abide one another peaceably.&lt;page&gt;Well, assuming you prevail, I&#8217;ll ask only that my labour may continue.

Or was this the aftermath anticipated all along?&lt;hpage&gt;In our meeting, a mortal blow was dealt, but the monarch&#8217;s desperate death throes now threaten to take this whole kingdom with her.&lt;page&gt;Ha! I&#8217;m not surprised! It&#8217;s always the way, aye? Your ancient kind, vying for dominion, and us mortal bugs squashed unseen underneath.&lt;hpage&gt;It was freedom I sought, Maker. Naive perhaps, but this is not the fate I wished to come.",再回来了，老一个？您与苍白的母亲发生争执的影响……显然是感应的。这些洞穴的命运让人感到严峻。还是这是一直期望的事？我并不感到惊讶！它总是这样，是吗？您的古老种类，争夺统治，而美国的致命虫在下面看不见。也许是天真的，但这不是我希望来的命运。

Her down now fills my cloak, and does much to ward against the frost of these heights.&lt;page&gt;To pass something so precious... That&#8217;s a mighty gift you&#8217;ve been given. Seems she&#8217;s thrown her lot in with you.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;d not have guessed her so opposed to our threaded monarch, but then she too must have sensed the wretched state of things, and the harsher change to come.",您是否在山顶上使用该生物对待？现在，她的倒台填补了我的斗篷，并且在这些高度的霜冻上做了很多措施。看来她与您一起投入了自己的意思。

MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_TALK_03,"&lt;hpage&gt;You have the sight, Maker. Tell me what you see in me?&lt;page&gt;Your mask... It reads clear enough, Old One. Watcher, hunter, monarch even, though you may reject that station.&lt;page&gt;A complex visage, perhaps, yet still to my sight it looks unresolved.&lt;hpage&gt;If you see a transitional state, it is one I have accepted. My mask has remained defined through lifetimes uncounted.&lt;page&gt;Aye.
