Bested fair, and yet you choose to stay the killing blow?&lt;hpage&gt;I can test you, Pinstress, and myself for what&#8217;s to come, but I will not cut you down.&lt;hpage&gt;Despite its quakes, Pharloom&#8217;s demise is not as certain as it seems.

It was a remarkable site indeed. I only hope that it shall not soon be lost.&lt;page&gt;Course you&#8217;ve seen it! Master at the blade and at the seeking. You&#8217;ve proven yourself an imposing talent. &lt;page&gt;Well, given you seem done up here, maybe its time you get back to your all important business?",dunno如果您听到了，请发出针头虫，但据说那是一个闪闪发光的秘密，隐藏在这座山上的核心。这确实是一个了不起的网站。我只希望它不会很快丢失。掌握刀片和寻求。您证明了自己是一个强大的才能。＆lt; page＆gt;好吧，鉴于您似乎在这里完成了，也许是时候回到所有重要的业务了？
STEEL_SERVANT_END_2,"&lt;page&gt;But the seer knows nothing! Nothing of the pain. All small Sula&#8217;s to bear... To watch, watch these lands dying, slow, the bugs suffering, falling, while our shell sustains...&lt;page&gt;The steelhearts feel so little... but we forced to serve, we endure it all. We alone. Why?&lt;hpage&gt;...Others may know that pain, small bug... Or at least something similar.&lt;page&gt;So will you chain me again? Herd me by point of your blade, and knowingly return me to that pain?&lt;hpage&gt;...I will not. I will inform the child of steel of what has transpired here, but I cannot force any bug to return to a task so cruel.&lt;page&gt;Then, then... Sula is free? At least to run? By your mercy, bug, these legs must move, quick, quick and far, far!",＆lt; page＆gt;但是先知一无所知！没有痛苦。所有的小苏拉（Sula＆Sula）都要忍受...要观看，看着这些土地垂死，慢速，虫子遭受痛苦，跌倒，而我们的炮弹却保持着……＆lt; page＆gt; page＆gt;钢铁心感觉很少……但是我们强迫我们忍受了一切。我们一个人。为什么？从你的刀片上放下我，并故意让我痛苦地痛苦？＆lt; hpage＆gt; ...我不会。我会告诉钢铁的孩子这里发生了什么事，但是我不能强迫任何错误返回任务如此残酷的任务。至少要运行？通过您的怜悯，虫子，这些腿必须移动，快速，快速，远！

I&#8217;d only go soft! How else is one expected to maintain their wits?&lt;hpage&gt;Then this is not a place of hiding? That Citadel up top seems no friend to the free, or the strong who&#8217;d choose to remain apart.&lt;page&gt;...Aye. Well, yes. That too&#8217;s a reason, though one that shames me some.&lt;page&gt;Our grand Citadel learnt well from the training of Pinstresses past. Then it went and turned those teaching upon us!&lt;page&gt;Despite our superior skills, our numbers have always been few and their strength overwhelmed.&lt;page&gt;Of my once revered order, only two of us remain, wormed away in Pharloom&#8217;s forgotten corners, and my pin-sibling, she&#8217;s lost herself to more peaceable pursuits.",＆lt; hpage＆gt; letstress，为什么您选择在这些暴风雨般的洞穴中生活？当然还有更多热情好客的地方吗？温暖？我只能变软！人们还期望如何保持自己的智慧？那个城堡上衣似乎没有免费的朋友，或者是坚强的人，他们选择保持分开。好吧，是的。这也是一个原因，尽管一个原因使我感到震惊。然后它去了那些教导我们！

For a vassal who defies the Masters?... You give Zi a thought, complex...&lt;page&gt;The outcome is different... and Zi must now observe alone... but this may be the better way?&lt;page&gt;Zi shall accept the happening... shall pray the Masters still see her loyal... and Zi too will share the hope... that her vassal lives long unbound.",＆lt; hpage＆gt; zi，您的附庸已经消失，活着，逃离了这些土地。不...苍白... Zi感觉到了您的会议...仪式...附庸会受到损害。他们触摸了黑暗。通过大师们，他们现在将被猎杀...无论距离逃跑了。在这里浪费奴役或自由逃跑。他们做出了自己的选择，并通过黑色的行动宣布了他们的黑色冠军，他们的黑暗冠军被杀了，但是运气或狡猾的人可能会看到他们生存。方式？
