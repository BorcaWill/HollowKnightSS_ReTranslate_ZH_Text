I would have you play it for me now.&lt;page&gt;Kakrt! She has visited the pontiff&#8217;s depths and stolen the sacred song! Where is your respect, Weaver-spawn?!

How hollow they echoed. The mantle of rule, claimed greedily from Pharloom&#8217;s fading first children, those bitter Weavers... it was yoke, not crown.&lt;page&gt;Now, in our Citadel&#8217;s silence, we share their truth. Only one monarch&#8217;s claws ever clutched this kingdom, though we raised our voices to cry otherwise.&lt;page&gt;Would you see her, pilgrim? Up there at our Citadel&#8217;s crown? Reach those heights we&#8217;d hoped to hide and bow before this land&#8217;s true ruler.&lt;hpage&gt;In time near, sir bug, I shall indeed climb to meet your monarch...",＆lt; hpage＆gt;您的房间肯定是宏伟的，先生，但很明显地看到您在这里不是主权。我们曾经蓬勃发展，这座城堡对我们的法令摇摆不定。统治的斗篷宣称是从伪造的，那些苦涩的孩子，那些痛苦的织布工……是轭，而不是皇冠。只有一个君主爪子曾经抓住这个王国，尽管我们提高了声音哭泣，否则。在我们的城堡王冠上吗？到达那些高度，我们希望在这片土地上躲藏和鞠躬。
