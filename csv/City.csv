If still their minds remained.",&lt;hpage&gt;我想看看你的收藏，金库守护者。&lt;page&gt;她可以看。一套完美的收藏。这位金库守护者充满了见解。其他同伴会嫉妒……如果他们还有头脑的话。

A grave transgression, the cause of much pain for many. But to speak of a sin... is to invite its return. I will say no more.",啊……你又带来了歌声，虽然对我这样不配的人来说也许是浪费了。&lt;hpage&gt;如果让你回答会痛苦可以不用说，但我必须问，圣堡因何罪囚禁了你？&lt;page&gt;我的罪？是严重的过错，给许多人带来了痛苦。但谈论罪过……就是邀请它重现。我不再多说了。

With regret, this sentinel must t-t-test the strength of your will.",&lt;hpage&gt;我原以为我是以朋友，至少是盟友的身份回应你的召唤，但现在我们站在一起，我能感受到你的意图。&lt;hpage&gt;你是要对我举刃吗？我是你的敌人吗？&lt;page&gt;保卫神圣圣堡，以及充盈其中的声音，是哨卫永恒的职责。&lt;page&gt;消灭所有被低语丝线迷惑者，是所有人的命运。&lt;hpage&gt;你认为我被丝线控制，是丝的奴隶？我想你比这更有洞察力。我的丝属于我自己，意志也是。&lt;page&gt;哨卫不确定。你看起来既被侵蚀又无辜。很遗憾，哨卫必须考验你的意志。

What is it you are charged with protecting?&lt;page&gt;Defence of the sacred C-c-citadel, and the voices that fill it-t-t, is our eternal duty.&lt;hpage&gt;I had assumed as much. Yet look around you, gilded one. During your slumber, the Citadel has fallen and its voices lay silent.

How hollow they echoed. The mantle of rule, claimed greedily from Pharloom&#8217;s fading first children, those bitter Weavers... it was yoke, not crown.&lt;page&gt;Now, in our Citadel&#8217;s silence, we share their truth.
