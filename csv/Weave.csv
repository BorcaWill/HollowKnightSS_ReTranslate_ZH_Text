CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_PT2,"&lt;page&gt;No. Not their enemy, and their prisoner not through malice. I am Eva, a thing... difficult to describe, a child of Weavers, yet not quite their kin...&lt;hpage&gt;How strange. That description could fit me as well as yourself. &lt;page&gt;Child of Weavers?... And not? I can detect your Weaver strain, yet you are different from them, and from me, a shifting, blended thing? What are you creature?&lt;page&gt;Step closer lady, that my senses would better understand your nature.",＆lt; page＆gt; no。不是他们的敌人，也不是他们的囚犯。我是伊娃（Eva），一件事……很难描述，是一个织布工的孩子，但他们的亲戚并不完全……＆lt; hpage＆gt;多么奇怪。这种描述可以适合我和你自己。＆lt; page＆gt;织布工的孩子吗？...而不是吗？我可以检测到您的织布株，但是您与它们不同，而与我有变化，混合的东西？您是什么生物？
CREST_UPGRADE_PRE_REPEAT_ADDITIONAL,"Lady, still my senses resound. You seem so far beyond the bounds of a bug.&lt;page&gt;Permit me to gaze again upon your nature, that I may offer clarity.",夫人，我的感觉仍然很响。您似乎超出了一个错误的范围。
CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_ACT3,"Lady? So you live, still. This is good... I had felt the conflict commence, pale hearts ablaze, and the sudden well of darkness after.&lt;hpage&gt;I am sorry, Eva. I had hoped to slay the monarch, and was near achieving that goal, but the situation has become... complicated. Now all of Pharloom threatens to fall.&lt;page&gt;But I can sense it in you, lady. You have not yielded to despair, so some hope must still remain?&lt;hpage&gt;...Slim hope, I suspect. But true, there may yet be a way through this disaster. I shall pursue that goal with whatever strength remains.&lt;page&gt;Then allow me to continue to aid you as I can... Mine might be a small contribution, but I shall provide it eagerly.",女士？所以你还活着。这很好...我感觉到冲突开始了，苍白的心燃烧，然后是黑暗的突然井。我很抱歉，伊娃。我曾希望杀死君主，并几乎实现了这个目标，但是情况已经变得……很复杂。现在，所有的伪造都可能跌倒了。您还没有屈服于绝望，所以我怀疑，仍然有一些希望仍然存在？但是确实，这场灾难可能仍有一种方法。我将以任何剩余的力量来追求这个目标。
CREST_UPGRADE_POST_ADDITIONAL_AVAILABLE,"Incredible... Your nature is so unlike a mortal bug&#8217;s. Yours is malleable, transitory. It is a marvelous thing, worth my long life to behold.&lt;page&gt;With what power I possess, I may still be able to aid you further.",令人难以置信的...您的本性与致命的错误不同。您的是延展的，短暂的。这是一件奇妙的事情，值得我长寿。
CREST_UPGRADE_TALK_SNARE,"&lt;hpage&gt;Eva, I am seeking a tool, told to be somewhere in this structure. It is a snare device of Weaver make. Do you know of it?&lt;page&gt;I may, lady. Search over from here, on side where the moss meets the nest. There my mothers built their tools, all traps and bindings. Small things, but tests for larger forms.&lt;page&gt;I still remember their thoughts as they worked, their desperation, and their hunger. Another hopeless attempt to wrest their freedom. All ended in failure, of course.",＆lt; hpage＆gt; eva，我正在寻找一种工具，被告知要在这种结构中处于某个地方。这是织布工的圈套装置。你知道吗？从这里搜索，在苔藓遇到巢穴的侧面。我的母亲在那里建造了他们的工具，所有陷阱和绑定。小事，但是测试了更大的形式。另一个无望夺取自由的尝试。当然，这一切都以失败结束。
CARETAKER_SNARE_READY,"Ain&#8217;t you come a long way, bellringer! Granting wishes, saving bugs, even rousing my sullen family to act!&lt;page&gt;The snare is set above, our power bound along its thread. To your sight it may seem a crude thing, but there&#8217;s fair strength to it... enough to quell a god.&lt;hpage&gt;You and your family have done me well, sir. I shall prove your faith in the meeting ahead.&lt;page&gt;Aye. Bring your best, bellringer. Call forth our great pale god. Cut her weak, then drive the beast down atop the snare.&lt;page&gt;Contact made will stir the snare alight, but only your needle&#8217;s song will awaken the spell in full. When that moment arrives, you&#8217;ll see it clear.",贝林格，你走了很长一段路！给予愿望，节省错误，甚至唤起我闷闷不乐的家庭行动！在您看来，这似乎是一件粗略的事情，但是那里的力量公平……足以平息神。我将证明您对未来会议的信心。带上最好的，贝林格。召集我们伟大的苍白神。削减了她的弱者，然后将野兽放在圈套的顶部。当那一刻到来时，您＆＃8217; ll看到它清晰。
CREST_UPGRADE_PRE_RETURNED,"&lt;page&gt;Lady, please. Permit me to look upon your nature, that I may offer clarity...",＆lt; page＆gt; lady，请。请允许我看着你的本性，我可以提供清晰度...
CREST_UPGRADE_POST,"Incredible... Your nature is so unlike a mortal bug&#8217;s. Yours is malleable, transitory. It is a marvelous thing, worth my long life to behold.&lt;page&gt;If in your travels you are able to further evolve, return to me. With what power I possess, I may be able to aid you further.&lt;hpage&gt;Thank you, Eva. If my nature expands as you say, I shall return.",令人难以置信的...您的本性与致命的错误不同。您的是延展的，短暂的。这是一件奇妙的事情，值得我长寿。凭借我拥有的力量，我也许可以进一步帮助您。如果我的天性如您所说，我将回来。
CARETAKER_SNARE_TALK1,"&lt;hpage&gt;I have known your kind before, sir. Yours is a tribe that works and trades in power, and I am about to extinguish its prime source.&lt;hpage&gt;Once this is done, will you truly delight in a land so bereft?&lt;page&gt;Aye, well... My family&#8217;s marks are all over that trap. And we&#8217;ve spent a hard age avoiding the gaze of our god.&lt;page&gt;If we earned it now, after such open opposition... that&#8217;s a bleak conclusion none of us&#8217;d care for.&lt;page&gt;Now! My job&#8217;s done. S&#8217;time your grand business began! We&#8217;ll be wishin&#8217; victory to you, bellringer, for all our sakes!",＆lt; hpage＆gt;先生，我以前认识你的同类。您的部落是一个在执政和交易的部落，我将消除其主要来源。而且，我们花了一个艰难的时代避免了我们的上帝的目光。我的工作完成了。S＆＃8217;您的大生意开始了！我们将成为Wishin＆＃8217;贝林格（Bellringer）胜利，为了我们的所有缘故！
CREST_UPGRADE_PRE,"&lt;hpage&gt;You see one&#8217;s nature, Eva? It is a skill far beyond bugs.&lt;page&gt;One not without cost. My sight perceives a bug only through the imprint upon their soul. &lt;hpage&gt;You speak of their crest? That signifier of a bug&#8217;s essence and their invisible yoke born through a lifetime.&lt;page&gt;Crest? Yes, the old Weaver term. A simple word to attempt description of something so profound.&lt;page&gt;But wait. Your own nature... Is it?...&lt;page&gt;Lady, permit me to look deeper still, that I may offer clarity...",＆lt; hpage＆gt;您看到一个人的性质，eva吗？这是一项远远超出错误的技能。我的视线只有通过他们的灵魂烙印才能意识到一个虫子。＆lt; hpage＆gt;您说他们的波峰吗？那个错误＆＃8217的象征及其一生中出生的无形轭。是的，旧的织布工。一个简单的词来尝试描述如此深刻的东西。你自己的天性...是吗？
CREST_UPGRADE_PROMPT,Allow Insight?,允许见解？
CREST_UPGRADE_REPEAT_ACT3,"Lady, Pharloom&#8217;s time grows short. If you are able to further expand your nature I urge you return to me.&lt;page&gt;Any power I possess, I shall grant it for your aid.&lt;hpage&gt;My thanks, Eva. If my nature expands as you say, I shall return.",夫人，滑织的时间越来越短。如果您能够进一步扩大自己的天性，我敦促您回到我身上。如果我的天性如您所说，我将回来。
CREST_UPGRADE_ACCEPT_DIALOGUE,Bind Eva?,绑定eva？
CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_CURSED,"Stay back, twisted leech! Even lodged within another&#8217;s shell, your ravenous nature shines clear.&lt;page&gt;You shall not defoul this chamber, nor claim my soul. Begone!",留下来，扭曲的水ech！即使在另一个＆＃8217的外壳中，您的狂热的性质也透明了。贝尼！
CREST_UPGRADE_FIRST_ALL,"Lady... Incredible... Your nature is so unlike a mortal bugs. Yours is malleable, transitory. It is a marvelous thing. Worth my long life to behold.&lt;page&gt;Unbound one, though we know each other little, permit me to ask a selfish request.&lt;hpage&gt;Your talent has provided a great benefit, Eva. What is it you desire of me?&lt;page&gt;Only to have my own soul, my own memories, bound within your shell... As you have done with those others throughout these lands.&lt;page&gt;I would not define as a crest within you, but my small strength may still grant a final boon.&lt;hpage&gt;You ask to be subsumed? Know your mind would cease to be, in any independent sense.&lt;page&gt;To be united with one unbound... This is the kind of escape I once prayed for, though the weight of ages had almost made me forget.&lt;page&gt;Lady, would you grant me this request?",女士...不可思议的...您的天性与致命的虫子不同。您的是延展的，短暂的。这是一件奇妙的事情。值得我长寿。您对我的需求是什么？从任何独立的意义上说，您的思想将不再是与一个未结合的人结合在一起的。
CREST_UPGRADE_ALL,"Lady, you are a multitude within a single shell. A being truly unbound. To aid your growth has proved a grand task, even for one as limited as me.&lt;page&gt;As my last act, permit me to ask a final, selfish request.&lt;hpage&gt;Your talents have provided great benefit, Eva. What is it you desire of me?&lt;page&gt;Only to have my own soul, my own memories, bound within your shell... As you have done with those others throughout these lands.&lt;page&gt;I would not define as a crest within you, but my small strength may still grant a final boon.&lt;hpage&gt;You ask to be subsumed? Know your mind would cease to be, in any independent sense.&lt;page&gt;I know. And still I seek it, gladly. To be united with one unbound... This is the kind of escape I once prayed for, though the weight of ages had almost made me forget.&lt;page&gt;Dear Lady, would you grant me this request?",女士，你是一个外壳中的众多。一个真正的未结合。为了帮助您的增长，证明了一项艰巨的任务，即使是我的最后一幕，即使我像我一样有限。您对我的需求是什么？在任何独立的意义上，都知道您的思想将不再是。我仍然很高兴地寻找它。与一个无限的人结合在一起...这是我曾经祈祷过的那种逃脱，尽管年龄的重量几乎使我忘记了。
CREST_UPGRADE_MEET,"Who&#8217;s there? Has someone come to free me? Or are you here to bring my end? &lt;hpage&gt;I am Hornet, prisoner, only a traveller and not here to slay you.&lt;hpage&gt;What cause sees you caged in these ruins of Weavers past? Were you their enemy?",谁在那里？有人来释放我吗？还是你来这里是我的结局？＆lt; hpage＆gt;我是大黄蜂，囚犯，只有一个旅行者，而不是在这里杀了你。你是他们的敌人吗？
CREST_UPGRADE_PRE_REPEAT,"Lady, my senses resound. You have grown further beyond the bounds of a bug.&lt;page&gt;Permit me to gaze again upon your nature, that I may offer clarity.",夫人，我的感觉很响。您已经超出了一个错误的范围。
CREST_UPGRADE_TALK_PURPOSE,"&lt;hpage&gt;How did you come to be sealed here, Eva? &lt;page&gt;Lady, you mistake. What seems a cage is as much my shell as the form inside.&lt;page&gt;I was born within this space. To leave would be my death, an uninspired end, though one I&#8217;ve sometimes wished would come.&lt;page&gt;I am unique, you see. My mothers shared the curse of their tribe, to conceive a child is a painful, near impossible task. &lt;hpage&gt;I know the curse well, Eva, for I am also it&#8217;s victim, and spawn of one who managed to overcome its limits. &lt;hpage&gt;Are you too an attempt to defy that cruel constraint?&lt;page&gt;A flawed attempt. A life spun from rune and shell, sustained only by its cage. My thoughts may mimic a Weavers but my senses are my own.&lt;page&gt;Over time, that difference brought only distance between us.",＆lt; hpage＆gt; eva，您是如何在这里密封的？＆lt; page＆gt;女士，你错误。看来的笼子就像我的内部形式一样多。离开将是我的死，这是一个毫无灵感的结局，尽管有时会想到一个i＆＃8217; page＆gt;我是独一无二的。我的母亲分享了他们部落的诅咒，以构想一个孩子是一项痛苦，几乎不可能的任务。＆lt; hpage＆gt; eva，我非常了解诅咒，因为我也是受害者的受害者，并且是一个设法克服其极限的人的产生。＆lt; hpage＆gt;您是否也是试图违抗残酷的约束？page＆gt;一种有缺陷的尝试。符文和壳的生命仅由笼子维持。我的想法可能会模仿织布工，但我的感觉是我自己的。
CREST_UPGRADE_ACCEPT,"By your grace, I am at last broken from my fate.&lt;hpage&gt;Gladly I accept your union, Eva. No longer shall you suffer eternity alone.",凭着你的恩典，我终于从命运中摔下来。您不再仅一个人遭受永恒。
CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_OVERBLUE,"Come no closer! I sense the forbidden blood coursing through you, that which grows and reshapes the world in its own vulgar image.&lt;page&gt;Whether it was imbibed willingly or not, none shall be allowed into this chamber while so afflicted. Begone!",不要再接近了！我感觉到禁忌的血液通过您而生的，它以其自身的庸俗形象而增长并重塑了世界。贝尼！
CREST_UPGRADE_REPEAT,"Lady, if in your travels you are able to further expand your nature, return to me. With what power I possess, I may be able to aid you further.&lt;hpage&gt;If my nature expands as you say, Eva, I shall return.",女士，如果您在旅途中您能够进一步扩大自己的天性，请回到我身边。有了我拥有的力量，我也许可以进一步帮助您。
CREST_UPGRADE_REOFFER,"Lady, would you think again upon my last request? To be bound amidst your shimmering soul?&lt;page&gt;I understand it is a selfish thing to ask, and I will hold no ill will if you reject.",女士，您会根据我的最后要求考虑吗？在您闪闪发光的灵魂中被束缚吗？
CREST_UPGRADE_DECLINE,"&lt;hpage&gt;I am sorry, Eva. I cannot grant you this. At least, not yet.&lt;hpage&gt;Yours is a mind strong and strange. That union could prove dangerous to my identity.&lt;page&gt;I understand, Lady. I will be here, if ever you reconsider.",＆lt; hpage＆gt;对不起，伊娃。我不能给你这个。至少还没有。那个工会可能对我的身份有危险。如果您重新考虑，我会在这里。
