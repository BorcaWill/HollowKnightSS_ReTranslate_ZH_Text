I may be able to send them safe to the caravan.&lt;page&gt;The locations! For price they could be shared, but you hold no map to mark! If learnings are wanted, a map must be owned. Until then, we have no trade to make.",&lt;hpage&gt;又见面了，大个子。你能活着找到旅团我一点都不担心。&lt;hpage&gt;能告诉我你为何离群索居，还练就这副体魄么？&lt;page&gt;吼……我是靠踪迹和气味追踪，找回我们的跳蚤同伴，尤其是幼崽，让族群壮大。&lt;hpage&gt;如果你知道其他失落跳蚤的位置，能告诉我吗？我也许能让他们安全归队。&lt;page&gt;位置可以告诉你，但你没有地图！想要情报，先有地图。在那之前没什么可谈的。

I may be able to send them safe to the caravan.&lt;page&gt;My learnings? Not free for you, bug not flea. Rosaries! Give those and I shall say of what I have sensed. Work like mine... much long, and hard. For that, I deserve some riches held.",&lt;hpage&gt;又见面了，大个子。在你们旅团里，我就知道你肯定能活着找到这里。&lt;hpage&gt;能告诉我你为何离群索居，还练就这副体魄么？&lt;page&gt;吼……虫子，不是跳蚤！我是靠踪迹和气味追踪，找回我们的跳蚤同伴，尤其是幼崽，让族群壮大。&lt;hpage&gt;如果你知道其他失落跳蚤的位置，告诉我。我也许能让他们安全归队。&lt;page&gt;我的情报？虫子，不是跳蚤，不白给。念珠！给我念珠我就告诉你。我的工作又苦又累，理应拿点报酬。

TROUPLE_HUNTER_MEET_COMPLETE,"&lt;hpage&gt;Fair greetings again, large flea. Of your many companions, I had little worry you would survive safe to find this caravan.&lt;hpage&gt;Would you tell me now of the task that saw you so apart from your fellows, and so fearsome in form?&lt;page&gt;Grrr....Mine was to track, by trail and smell and senses sharp. Find our friend fleas, our young most of most, to bring them together so strong they could grow.&lt;page&gt;A task once important, mine! But not now. All fleas are here, safe. A rare many! Time for toasts, and brew to fill our bellies!",&lt;hpage&gt;又见面了，大个子。你能活着找到旅团我一点都不担心。&lt;hpage&gt;能告诉我你为何离群索居，还练就这副体魄么？&lt;page&gt;吼……我以前负责追踪，靠着足迹气味，找回幼崽养壮族群。&lt;page&gt;这差事曾经很重要，但现在没必要了！所有跳蚤都在这里，安全无恙！该喝酒庆祝了！
TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_CANLEAVE,"Look here! All these lively fleas flocked to our caravan. Thanks to you and your hunting, our numbers grow grand. Mayhap, in time, we could grow to match even those caravans of our fabled past?&lt;hpage&gt;To see so many safe is a welcome sight, Fleamaster. Their playful cheer suggests you are a fine steward for the swelling troupe.&lt;page&gt;Such kind words, Miss Hornet! How lucky we are to have found a friend so fair!&lt;page&gt;But now, we must away! These moors have been our host long enough. It is time to climb and hoist towards drier caves!&lt;page&gt;Good friend to fleas, would you join us on this next journey?",看！这么多活蹦乱跳的跳蚤加入了旅团。多亏你的帮助，队伍越来越壮大。也许有朝一日能重现传说中的盛况？&lt;hpage&gt;看到这么多跳蚤平安无事真让人欣慰。他们的欢声笑语也说明你是个好领队。&lt;page&gt;大黄蜂小姐过奖了！能结交你这样的朋友才是旅团的幸运！&lt;page&gt;但现在该启程了！沼地虽好，但不应久留，该向更干燥的洞窟进发了！&lt;page&gt;跳蚤之友，愿意与我们一起出发吗？

And now fate has brought us back together again... what a marvel!&lt;hpage&gt;It is good to see you safe, Fleamaster. The journey to this moor from the caverns below is long and dangerous.&lt;page&gt;Dangerous, certainly, but we fleas are born to roam!&lt;page&gt;And now, you must go and see Grishkin, sitting there by the bubbling cauldron. After long travel, we drink to revive our spirits!",啊！大黄蜂小姐！又见面真是太好了！&lt;page&gt;这一路很长，但我们一只跳蚤都没丢！命运让我们重逢，真是奇迹！&lt;hpage&gt;旅团平安就好，从下方洞窟到这沼地，路上肯定充满危险。&lt;page&gt;确实很危险，但跳蚤天生爱流浪！&lt;page&gt;现在你该去找格里什琴了，她就在冒泡的大锅旁。长途跋涉后该喝点提神！

Nor would I contest your right to this cave.&lt;hpage&gt;I have encountered several of your fellows fleas, united in a caravan. Perhaps you would consider joining with them?&lt;hpage&gt;Yours seems a hardy hide, and I fear alone they lack the strength to survive long in this land.&lt;page&gt;Caravan? Grrr. Felt it in my fur... Time for change. If caravan is close, then my task, these lands, may near be complete.&lt;page&gt;Now... Grrr. Much talk I gave. You leave me!
