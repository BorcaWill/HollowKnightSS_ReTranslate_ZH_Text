Their mastery will require some commitment on my part.&lt;page&gt;Bug-Red, you are the first organic shell to fuse our memories.

I am grateful for the insight.",＆lt; hpage＆gt;大师，我已经与上面的神社交流。您的学习是独特的技术，它来自Cogwork心。他们的掌握将需要我的某些承诺。S-S-S-Such行为，我的台词本来可以相信不可能的。＆lt; page＆gt;尽管如此，您的广泛的阿森纳确实暗示了与M-M-M机械工艺的强烈亲和力，足以允许进入我们的思想店。我感谢洞察力。

ARCHITECT_WEAVER_SHOOT,"A fine artefact you carry there, Bug-Red. That broken tool, it is Weaver-make? &lt;hpage&gt;I believe so, Master. A relic of their old workshop, lost in fetid caves beyond this Citadel.&lt;hpage&gt;The parts suggest a weapon of thread, one I would attempt to repair myself, had I endless time.&lt;page&gt;An Architect&#8217;s work owes much to the art of the f-f-first children. They set expert standard for the tools and talents of Pharloom eternal.&lt;page&gt;If you desire-demand, I can remake the tool, though my own mind-directives may produce u-u-u-nique result.",您随身携带的精美人工制品，bug-red。那损坏的工具，是织布工吗？＆lt; hpage＆gt;我相信，大师。他们的旧研讨会的遗物，在这座城堡以外的臭洞穴中迷失了。他们为paglloom Eternal的工具和才能设定了专家标准。

ARCHITECT_WILL_LEAVE,"My s-s-service to you, Bug-Red... As it concludes I must speak-confess. Long now I have felt my rotors slow their s-s-spin. My limbs lift weak. An ending is felt, coming, sudden-certain...welcome.&lt;hpage&gt;Whatever fading you feel has not shown in your craft, Master. You have provided tools of immaculate make.&lt;hpage&gt;What will follow if you pass? Would another take your place? &lt;page&gt;One cannot. The skill to construct an Architect... That was taken by t-t-time. I am the last-final. The core remains to sustain the song, but no more Architects to tend-toil or build anew. &lt;page&gt;S-s-strange... &#8216;For Pharloom eternal,&#8217; states the d-d-directive-cage. But how can eternity sustain without an Architect to serve? This seems e-e-error. An end? An error... welcome?",我对您的S-S-Service，bug-red ...得出结论，我必须说话。现在很久以前，我感觉到我的圆圈慢慢了他们的S-S旋转。我的四肢抬起。感觉到结局，即将到来，突然发现...欢迎。您提供了完美制作的工具。另一个会代替你吗？＆lt; page＆gt;一个人。构建建筑师的技能……是由T-T-Time掌握的。我是最后一场。核心仍然可以维持这首歌，但没有更多的建筑师可以重新建立或重新建造。＆lt; page＆gt; s-s-strange ...＆＃8216;对于pharloom Eternal，＆＃8217;指示D-D指示式式式式式栅格。但是，如果没有建筑师服务，永恒如何维持？这似乎是E-E-Error。结局？错误...欢迎？

Yes! There was melody, once, but its sound... that I possess no longer...&lt;page&gt;T-t-t-too long I have worked. From my mind-vault, the imprint has f-f-faded. With many things it is like this... remembrance, dimmed...&lt;page&gt;But you m-m-may hear it, still. At the height of our core,  there is means-s-s-system, near complete... Constructs old-built to sound our song.

Have you climbed our c-c-core, and woken the voices of my l-l-line?&lt;hpage&gt;I have maker. Clearly it was a climb never intended for regular bugs, and fair fortune that the skills gifted within your lands allowed my ascent.&lt;hpage&gt;The melody, and the voices... both are fine things heard and witnessed.
