Discovered the depths of obsession that brought this place so low?&lt;hpage&gt;If you speak of this Citadel and its Silk, Caretaker, then yes, I now know the start of it. &lt;hpage&gt;In the ward down below, I saw it clear, the hollowed husks, and the many torturous implements... machines to instill a bug with thread, that would see their life extended.&lt;page&gt;Aye! That&#8217;s it, in part! But there&#8217;s more scale to it than all that. Just think of&#8217;em greedily shoving the Silk into their shells, the madness that overcame them, eternal life for mortal bugs! Then think on how long it&#8217;s all gone on...&lt;hpage&gt;...The children born of them, and all the pilgrims after... The Silk has seeded deep into this kingdom&#8217;s shells, generations deep...&lt;hpage&gt;No wonder Pharloom&#8217;s bugs proved such easy prey for that haunted thread. It had only to seek for itself to reach them.&lt;page&gt;Ho ho! Now your seein&#8217; it, bellringer! These poor pilgrims, all born bound to the cruel system of our world, now stricken in its new cursed web.&lt;page&gt;You at least are free from it.

You still following me around, trying to pinch away some of the goodies I sniff out?&lt;hpage&gt;You mistake my intent, ma&#8217;am, somewhat ungenerously. The pilgrims of the settlement below were worried by your long absence. It was on their behalf that I tracked you, again.&lt;page&gt;Is that so? What a worrying bunch of busybodies they are! I&#8217;m still able to fend for meself!&lt;page&gt;Hmph... and yet, perhaps &#8216;tis a warm thing that I remain in their thoughts so. I hadn&#8217;t expected that.

They say the keepers inside were jealous hoarders even before the silken curse came down.&lt;hpage&gt;You have more familiarity with the Citadel than most, madam. How long have you spent here, surviving amongst the haunted corridors?&lt;page&gt;Oh, long enough. S&#8217;not such a bad lot, all told. The memories of my pilgrimage have all faded now, but a life spent in the Citadel&#8217;s golden halls was all I ever wished for.&lt;page&gt;And lo and behold, my humble wish was granted! Certainly, the place might be a bit past its prime, but it&#8217;d be churlish of me to complain now, wouldn&#8217;t it?",亲爱的，寻找自己的好东西吗？您会做得很好，以避免这里附近的黑穹顶。他们说，里面的守护者甚至在丝绸的诅咒掉下来之前就嫉妒ho积者。您在这里度过了多长时间，在闹鬼的走廊中生存了？S＆＃8217;都没有那么糟糕。我的朝圣的回忆现在已经消失了，但是我曾经希望的是在城堡里度过的生活。当然，这个地方可能已经超过了它的巅峰时期，但是现在我抱怨的是我很高兴，这不是吗？

CARETAKER_LACE_DEFEATED,"&lt;hpage&gt;Sir, I have opened the way above these halls, and bested the white knight that stood as guardian.&lt;hpage&gt;Child of the monarch, she claimed herself at the end, and her shell suggested it true, a being born purely from Silk woven tight. &lt;hpage&gt;That such a feat is possible... I have seen life woven from Silk before, but tiny, transient... Never like this...&lt;page&gt;Aye, bellringer! You&#8217;ve slain a marvel indeed... Well, flawed marvel, at least.&lt;page&gt;One to keep far from she was, least for us mortal sorts. Look of a child and a mind to match, but her&#8217;s been up wanderin&#8217; this Citadel longer&#8217;n most. Even in its long silence, way &#8216;fore you came and roused its ire. &lt;page&gt;Might&#8217;a seen herself this place&#8217;s protector, keepin&#8217; it clean and quiet as she did. Course quiet meant most crossin&#8217; her path found a painful end from her pin.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;d be sayin&#8217; thanks for the slaying, but with all the other husks now awoken and enraged, a bug&#8217;s chances ain&#8217;t grown by much.",＆lt; hpage＆gt;先生，我已经在这些大厅上方打开了道路，并击败了君主的孩子的白人骑士。＆lt; hpage＆gt;＆gt;＆gt;我以前见过丝绸的生活，但是很小，短暂的...从来没有像这样...您确实被杀死了一个奇迹……嗯，至少有缺陷的奇迹。看上去是一个孩子和一个人的思想，但她的wanderin＆＃8217;这座城堡最长的＆＃8217; n。即使在漫长的沉默中，您也来了，您来了，引起了愤怒。＆lt; page＆gt; a可以看到这个地方的保护者＆＃8217; keepin＆＃8217;它像她一样干净整洁。课程安静意味着大多数交叉＆＃8217;她的道路从她的别针中发现了一个痛苦的结局。感谢您的杀戮，但是随着其他所有果壳的唤醒和激怒，一个错误的机会却大大增加了。
CITY_MERCHANT_MEET,"Hello again, dear one. Looks like we both made it up here, safe as told. And what a shock to find you were speaking the truth about this place!&lt;page&gt;A settlement like this in the Citadel, nice and safe, cloistering so many bugs with minds intact!
