My shock would be great if another here managed the feat.&lt;hpage&gt;I slew a tall creature above the town, a Weaver I suspect, though one twisted in purpose.&lt;hpage&gt;By voice and claw it aided, perhaps guided, the thread that strung the town. &lt;page&gt;Weaver? Those vicious old things! To our young we tell the tales, but had thought them long dead, only corpses bound in spires. &lt;hpage&gt;This one still lived, though if it was a Weaver, it was broken in a savage way.&lt;hpage&gt;Its own Silk was bound, pinned deep within its shell.

To meet one in combat means great challenge, and great pride in victory.",Poshanka，挥舞针的孩子。这个心脏不受其诅咒的束缚。如果这里的另一个人管理着这一壮举。＆lt; page＆gt; weaver？那些恶毒的旧事物！对于我们的年轻人，我们讲述了故事，但曾认为它们已经死了，只有在尖顶上绑定的尸体。＆lt; hpage＆gt;尽管它是织布工，但它以一种野蛮的方式被打破了。在见证之前，一个残酷的惩罚i ve te ve a ve ve。＆lt; page＆gt;即使破碎，我的嫉妒仍然是。织布工的寓言技巧...在战斗中遇到一个意味着巨大的挑战，并为胜利而感到自豪。
MAPPER_GENERIC_GREYMOOR,"&lt;hpage&gt;Fair greetings, Shakra. You are a welcome sight amidst the sodden gloom of these caverns. &lt;page&gt;Child Wielding Needle, your aspect is still sharp. My respect remains. Heed a warning, many fierce bugs roost nearby.&lt;page&gt;On the lake beyond this cave nest a ragged horde atop an old watermound. Their mastery of flight makes them dangerous. My shell will forever carry the score of their pins.&lt;page&gt;If you&#8217;re seeking a safer path, head back, towards this land&#8217;s core.",＆lt; hpage＆gt; shakra公平的问候。在这些洞穴的忧郁忧郁中，您是可喜的景象。＆lt; page＆gt;挥舞着针的孩子，您的方面仍然很清晰。我的尊重仍然是。注意警告，附近有许多凶猛的虫子。他们掌握飞行使它们危险。如果您要寻求更安全的路径，我的外壳将永远带有他们的销钉的分数。

Now arrived, I find it free, and its few remaining residents offering trade and welcome.&lt;hpage&gt;I slew a tall creature above the town, a Weaver I suspect, though one twisted in purpose.&lt;hpage&gt;It was her you may have sensed. A formidable force, even aged. By voice and claw she aided, perhaps guided, the haunted thread that grasps these lands. &lt;page&gt;Weaver? Those vicious things. To our young we tell the tales, but had thought them long dead, only corpses bound in spires. &lt;hpage&gt;This one still lived, though if it was a Weaver, it was broken in a savage way.&lt;hpage&gt;Its own Silk was bound, pinned deep within its shell.
